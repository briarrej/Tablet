      <h1>Chicago: The Black Experience</h1>
      <p>Chicago is a melting pot for multiple cultures, but the culture of Black people 
        in Chicago is one that is important and extremely personal. There are so many 
        organizations, restaurants, and events ran by Black people that have a 
        positive impact on the community.

      <h2>Shawn Michelle's </h2>
      <p>Shawn Michelle’s is a Black-owned Ice Cream parlor. Every dessert at Shawn Michelle’s 
        is homemade, from the ice cream to the pastries. There are over 20 ice cream flavors that 
        drive customers down memory lane. Some of these nostalgic flavors are Lunchroom Butter Cookie,
         Honey Cinnamon Graham Cracker, Grandma’s Old-Fashioned, and more. They are also known for their 
         amazing cobblers: peach, apple, and blueberry cobblers. Shawn Michelle is located in the Bronzeville 
         community of the South Side of Chicago. During the summer, Shawn Michelle’s lines are usually wrapped 
         around the block! The restaurant truly brings luxury desserts to the community. </p>
